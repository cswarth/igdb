# ogrdb

An effort to fit [IgPdb](http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~ihmmune/IgPdb/index.php) into a [community-defined schema](http://b-t.cr/t/germline-set-format-the-way-forward/199).
Note that the schema has evolved significantly since this effort.

In this case, the schema is implemented as a series of JSON objects. Have a look at the various `.json` files here and in `schemas`.
